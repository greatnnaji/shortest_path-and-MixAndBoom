Program Description: This file contains two programs, that first is a .java file called MixAndBoom which the input begins with an integer in a single line, which is the number of chemicals. The chemicals are numbered from 1 to N. Next, there is a sequence of lines, each containing a pair of integers (between 1 and N inclusive), representing two chemicals that explode when mixed. If it is possible to store the chemicals safely, your program should output “yes”, and “no” otherwise.
The other is a snakes and ladders game which derives the shortest path. The input begins with an integer in a single line, which represents the board dimension N. Next, there is a sequence of lines, each containing a pair of integers (between 1 and N*N inclusive), representing either a ladder or a snake. A ladder is represented by a pair where the first number is smaller than the
second, and the opposite for snakes. Your program should output a single integer representing the minimum number of dice rolls required to reach the location N*N.
